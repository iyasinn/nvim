# 💤 Neovim Configuration

A minimal and efficient Neovim setup.

## 📌 Prerequisites
- **Neovim** version **0.10** or later

## 🚀 Installation
1. **Install Neovim** (if not already installed). You can use your package manager:
   ```sh
   # macOS (Homebrew)
   brew install neovim
   
   # Ubuntu
   sudo apt install neovim
   
   # Arch Linux
   sudo pacman -S neovim
   ```

2. **Clone this repository** into your Neovim configuration directory:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neovim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
   ```

3. **Restart Neovim** to apply the changes.

## 🎯 Usage
Your Neovim is now configured and ready to use!

## 📖 Additional Notes
- If you encounter issues, ensure your Neovim version is **0.10+**.
- You may need to install additional dependencies based on your plugins.
- Customize the configuration further by modifying files in `~/.config/nvim/`.

## 🎩 Credits
This configuration is built upon the excellent [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/), providing a modular and efficient setup.
